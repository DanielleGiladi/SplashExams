What the problem?

Scheduling exams takes way too long...
It's done manually, and it takes weeks to get an initial schedule from the exams department.
Today the way to scheduling exams is done manually by the exams department.

SplashExams designed to save a huge amount of time and automatically schedule exams in seconds.

The challenge of the system is to consider different constraints, some of which are mandatory and some have to be prioritized by different criteria, such as exams period and the number of days between exams.

 SplashExams receives the requirements from the user and automatically calculates scheduling that meets as many constraints as possible.

SplashExams creates scheduling in seconds and optimizes the current scheduling time over 90% relative to manual work.

I developed the system fully in Java integrated with rational DERBY DB and implemented an algorithm that provides an efficient solution considering the scheduling constraints and limitations.
Using JavaFX to develop the UI of the system.
